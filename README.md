# FAQ
## General

### Why should I use the Container Profiler?

#### Easy to use profiling for applications or workflows in a container. 

## Usage

### How do I use the Container Profiler on my own container?

1\. Install the Container Profiler

2\. Here the common [use cases](docs/build.md) for applying the Container Profiler to profile a continer 

## Miscellaneous
### How should I reference the Container Profiler if I use it?

# MANUAL
## GENERAL INFORMATION
The Container Profiler can be used as a tool to profile an application or workflow by taking interval snapshots of a collection of linux resource utilization metrics throughout the course of the job. These snapshots are then stored as JSON data which can then be used to see how the metrics changed once the job is finished.

In order to use the Container Profiler, a container with an application/workflow/script to be run and profiled is needed.
### Overview: Running the Container Profiler


## Container Profiler

ContainerProfiler includes bash scripts **rudataall.sh** to profile the resource utilization on VM level, container level and process level and **deltav2.sh** to compute the delta statistics of resource utilization between two time instances. Detailed usage of the profiler script can be found in the YouTube video linked below (demo scripts can be found in profiler_demo directory).

## Metrics Description 
=======

The text below describes the metrics captured by the script **rudataall.sh** for profiling resource utilization on the 
virtual machine (VM) level, container level and process level. A complete metrics description spreadsheet can be found at

## Tutorial: Profiling a Container

## Video Demonstration
**Video:**     https://youtu.be/X-_7zqeyffk
## Install the Container Profiler
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wlloyduw/ContainerProfiler
```

## Preparing the Container Profiler - Method 1
Navigate to /ContainerProfile/profiler_demo/sleep_test

![](./profiler_demo/sleep_test/Tutorial_1_pics/tutorial_method1_1.png)

Open "Dockerfile"

![](./profiler_demo/sleep_test/Tutorial_1_pics/tutorial_method1_2.png)

  1) This file determines how your container is built and with what packages. Make sure you keep the first run line ("RUN apt-get install update -y"), but remove/add any other packages you may need. For this tutorial, leave this file unedited.

Now that the dockerfile is set up, you can build the container with the command "sudo docker build -t 'container-name' ." (Can replace container-name with any name). To confirm the creation of the container, typing sudo docker images into the console will let you see if the container has been created.

![](./profiler_demo/sleep_test/Tutorial_1_pics/tutorial_method1_3.png)
 
Open "runDockerProfile.sh". The line starting with "DOCKERCMD=" is doing a lot of stuff.  It is building the command that will start the docker container and mounts the directory on the host machine that is running the tool to the data directory in the container.  This is necessary in order to get the json ouput files containing all your metrics onto your host machine.  Otherwise they would go away when the container dies.

![](./profiler_demo/sleep_test/Tutorial_1_pics/tutorial_method1_5.png)

There are two empty variables in this file that need to be set. One is the container name, and the other is your host path. The container name needs to be the name of the container you are running, and the host path is the path to where the tool is running (Can use "pwd" in terminal to confirm the directory is correct).

![](./profiler_demo/sleep_test/Tutorial_1_pics/tutorial_method1_6.png)

Open "process_pack.sh".  This file contains the bash commands that will be executed in the container.  It contains the commands for sysbench and stress-ng by default.  Delete them and enter your own commands for the job you'd like to profile. For this tutorial, you should leave this file unedited.

## Preparing the Container Profiler - Method 2
An alternate method to using the container profiler by downloading the alpine/ubuntu containerized version.

To build

docker build -t biodepot/profiler:alpine_3.7 .
To use the alpine container

docker run --rm  -it -v $PWD:/.cprofiles  biodepot/profiler:alpine_3.7 sleep 10
If you leave out the volume mapping

-v <host_dir>:/.cprofiles
then no profiling will take place. Otherwise the json files will appear in <host_dir>

The delta is set to 1 second by default. This can be changed by changing the DELTA environment variable i.e.

The following command collects data every 2 seconds

docker run --rm  -it -v $PWD:/.cprofiles -e DELTA=2 biodepot/profiler:alpine_3.7 sleep 10
Finally, internally the json files are stored in the /.cprofiles directory. This can be changed using the OUTPUTDIR environment variable i.e. to have the json files written internally to /var/profiles:

docker run --rm  -it -v $PWD:/var/profiles -e OUTPUTDIR='/var/profiles' biodepot/profiler:alpine_3.7 sleep 10
This option is included on the off-chance that the default /.cprofiles is in use for something else.



## Graph Visualizations

The container profiler offers scripts that can be used to graph JSON output from the container profiler.

The guide to using the graphing scripts can be found here: [link to Graphing scripts!](https://github.com/wlloyduw/ContainerProfiler/tree/david/profiler_demo/sleep_test/Graphing)


## JSON to CSV
In addition to graphing scripts, we also provide a script to convert JSON data to CSV files. Each JSON file correspond to a row in a CSV file, and the column data will be the resource utilization metrics. The JSONtoCSV script can be found here:
